# document-classifier
This project builds a machine learning model to classify each page of a document (e.g., Profit &amp; Loss, Balance Sheet, etc.) based on its text content. The app uses TF-IDF for feature extraction and Logistic Regression for classification, with a Streamlit UI for predictions.
